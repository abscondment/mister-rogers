TODOs for mister-rogers

* For 1.0
** TODO Write tests.
** TODO Better config
*** Figure out which aleph/netty options need to be exposed.
**** timeouts? max connections?
*** Allow config file to be specified from command line.
** TODO Better request routing
*** Define the REST api - should be fairly simple.
*** Figure out if there's some good, lightweight existing library to use.
** TODO Faster tree building
*** Currently reads, converts to objects, makes tree. Instead, should read & instert raw values into tree. Let the tree library handle conversion.
** MAYBE Incorporate upcoming kdtree updates
*** API to Add/Remove from existing tree
*** tree stats (depth/nodes/etc)?
** MAYBE Disable asynchronous rebuild by default?
* Future
** MAYBE Return Clojure/Java objects via Netty's ObjectEcho protocol
